# fd-solar

A hacked together service using Quarkus, SmallRye Reactive Messaging MQTT adapter 
and a Postgres RDB with the timescaledb extension to perform realtime data extraction 
of inverter data from a SolarAssistant monitoring system (https://solar-assistant.io) 
as well as a programmable control and configuration platform.
